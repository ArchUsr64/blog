# My growth through The Linux Kernel Mentorship Program
<!-- Why does Github Editor not have a ruler??!  Reference 80 character line -->
## Introduction
### About the program
Form the official [website](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/lkmp):
> The Linux Kernel Mentorship Program offers a structured remote learning
> opportunity to aspiring Linux Kernel developers. Experienced Linux Kernel
> developers and maintainers mentor volunteer mentees and help them become
> contributors to the Linux Kernel.  

***TL;DR:*** The program helps beginners like me get started in Kernel Development.

### Application Process
The learning journey started right as I applied for the program through [LFX](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/#projects_all).
I was assigned a few tasks to complete as precondition for the mentorship as well
as the requirement to complete LFD103 ([A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Linux Kernel Development](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/a-beginners-guide-to-linux-kernel-development-lfd103/)) course.
Completing the prerequisite tasks served as a gentle introduction to the upcoming
program. Tasks ranged from detecting PCI and USB devices on the device using sysfs to
compiling and booting your own kernel!

I had to rush to finish LFD103 since the deadline was swiftly approaching, the
course gave me a general overview of the linux development process and how to
work with mailing lists.

With my application done and the course completed, I was eager to put my newly aquired skills to good use.
Excited by the prospects of contributing to **The Linux Kernel**, I submitted a few superfluous [patches](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/?q=d%3A..2023%2F9%2F1+f%3A%22anshulusr%40gmail.com%22).
Although well intentioned, the patches did not receive the warm open hearted reception
I was expecting. This experience taught me what working on the kernel
was all about. The goal is to provide best possible experience to the users and
patches fixing minor formatting issues don't do that.
